# [Marvin](http://cmsc838f-s15.wikispaces.com/Marvin)

This is the code to create Marvin using a Kinect v2, Arduino, Adafruit motor shield, and Servos. Marvin is a wall-mounted bot that responds to your actions in a physical space. He performs four different actions based on what you are doing. When you enter his space, he will greet you. If you greet him back, he will wave his hand. If you show him a fist, he will raise his hands to show that he is ready to fight. Finally, he does not like to be approached very fast. So, he will try to respond and stop you by waving his hands very fast.
